## How to Play

If you've ever played a side-scrolling platformer game, you know how to play this game. If you haven't this is a great place to start.

The goal of the game is to reach the very end (to the right). You'll have to jump onto different rocks and lilypads to get there, but be careful. One of the rocks sink when you land on it!

If you fall, you'll respawn at the beginning of the level. Don't worry, you'll get as many tries as you want!

### Controls

← Move left

→ Move right

↑ Jump

## Intent

I created this game in my senior year of high school as my promposal. With the limited amount of time I had, the Phaser React + Vite template came in handy (you can find the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/phaserjs/template-react). I remember pouring in so much time trying to relearn and learn new bits and pieces of JavaScript while simultaneously learning how Phaser worked. In the end, through much JavaScript headscratching, intricate sprite art in [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/), and examinations of the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) documentation, I created something that I actually enjoy revisiting from time to time.

This game was created for my amazing girlfriend.
